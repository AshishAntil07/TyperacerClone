  `This seemingly idle question may not be all that simple to answer. One thing is sure, 1,000 words all written without any paragraph spacing will drive your reader a little mad. The first point is clear: 1,000 words is a lot of words. Split it up into paragraphs for heaven's sake, or expect your intended readers to head for the hills for a chance to rest their weary eyes on some open space.`,
  `"White space" is a wonderful illusion that tells your reader what you have to say is pretty easy to take in. I've seen some news articles in which each paragraph is only one sentence long. I feel that's taking it to extremes, and it can have the opposite effect of making your writing look disjointed. I like to see at least three or four lines to a paragraph, and as an indication, my longest paragraph so far is just 74 words long.`,
  `You can assume commercial writing and news reports will have paragraphs approximately half as long as the ones you'd see in academic or essay writing. In this case, we're looking at ten to twenty paragraphs per 1,000 words instead of five to ten.`,
  `Count 'em: two characters for the word, and three for the punctuation marks. To begin with, you'd introduce or refer to your speakers, but once the conversation is flowing nicely, you can start skipping them at times.`,
  `It's a lot less cumbersome to skip a mention of the speaker than to add "said Mary" and "John said" after every direct quote. So theoretically, you can have a paragraph consisting of one word plus punctuation marks. 1,000 words in direct speech would therefore mean you'd write way more than the five or ten paragraphs our initial guideline suggested.`,
  `Not necessarily, but bear in mind that even teachers who are paid to read students' writing get tired eyes. The easier it is to read and understand what you have written, the more likely your teacher is to notice those clever details you included. There's also a distinct possibility they won't start hating you while they read your work. Yes, they're supposed to be unbiased, but everyone is human!`,
  `To take easy reading to the next level, try using sub-headers every paragraph to three paragraphs. This is applicable to blogs and web pages, and to a certain extent, in academic writing. When you hit a web page for info, what do you do? I look at the header, and then I scan the sub-heads to get an idea of the writer's approach to the subject. If it looks like fluff, I kill the page and move on. But if the sub-headers are interesting, and seem to tell me there's something worth learning, I'll read the whole piece.`,
  `One thing that students must do during their academic lives is writing a 1000 words essay. This can look like an intimidating number, and many students are left wondering how long it can take. A simple search on the internet will give questions such as "how long is a 1000 words essay?" or "how many pages are in that kind of paper?"`,
  `Not always the topic is given, and the opportunity of choosing the subject of your essay can be a big plus: if you are wondering, "What should I write my essay on?" go for an issue you are well up in or with a lot of available material, both online and in libraries. There are countless possible 1000 words essay topics; a personal point of view is to avoid themes that involve you emotionally, taking otherwise the risk of losing objectivity.`,
  `The essay's length will depend on how creative you are and the essay's structure. You can choose having a 5 paragraph essay or divide all your thoughts into different paragraphs. Take note that the more paragraphs are in your essay, the better. This is because it can be hard reading and comprehend long paragraphs. The good idea has eight paragraphs for 1000 words.`,
  `Einstein also gave impetus to the science of cosmology. His equations proved that the universe was dynamic, either expanding or contracting. This refuted the opinion of the time that the universe was static. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was actually expanding, as Einstein's equations had predicted.`,
  `The greatest physicist that he was, Einstein was very vocal in his views. When asked. From where he got his scientific ideas, Einstein explained that he believed scientific work best proceeds from an examination of physical reality. One also has to search for underlying axioms, with consistent explanations that apply in all instances and avoid contradicting each other. He also recommended theories with visualisable results.`,
  `The American entrepreneur, philanthropist and the Chairman of Microsoft, was born on 28th October, 1955 into a wealthy Seattle family. His father was a prominent attorney and mother, a bank board member. A story goes that, at his birth, his father set-up a million-dollar fund for him. But, Gates denied it. But one thing that is for sure, is that he had the best of education, including 3 years at Harvard.`,
  `As a student, Gates excelled in elementary school, particularly in Mathematics and Sciences. At 13, he was enrolled in the Lakeside School, Seattle's most exclusive preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the school mothers used proceeds' from Lakeside's rummage sale to buy an ASR-33 teletype terminal and a block of computer time in a General Electric Computer.`,
  `Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC and was excused from Maths classes to pursue his interest. After the Mothers' Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on other systems, including DEC PDP minicomputer. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Centre Corporation, which banned the Lakeside students for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.`,
  `Since beginning, Bill Gates was on the lookout for opportunities. So, after reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8,800, Gates contacted MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), the creators of the new microcomputer. He informed them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. MITS President, Ed Roberts, agreed to meet them for a demo and when Gates demonstrated his work, it was a success.`,
  `The Taj Mahal is the materialized vision of love and marks a perfect indelible remark on it's Mughal Architecture. This historical monument is the mausoleum of Emperor Shan Jahan's beloved wife, Empress Arjuman Banu Begum, most commonly known as Mumtaz mahal. The Taj Mahal is a complex comprising of the astonishing vision Ustad Isa Khan of Turkey, the chief architect of this historic monument.`,
  `About Taj Mahal, The conventional story behind the stunning 17th-century marble mausoleum is Emperor Shah Jahan's eternal for Mumtaz, who died in childbirth. Historians believe that Shah Jahan remained heartbroken over the Empress's death and ordered his court into mourning for two whole years. To treasure all memories of his beloved wife, Shah Jahan undertook the task of building the world's most treasured beautiful monument as a symbol of love.`,
  `The grandeur of the Taj Mahal despite decades after construction resonates as the most attractive human-made tourist spot of the world. The Taj Mahal unveils five major structural components - the Darwaza or the main entrance, the Bageecha or gardens, the Masjid or Mosque, the Naqqar Khana or the rest house, and Rauza, the central mausoleum.`,
  `Located on banks of the sacred river Yamuna, in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, the Taj Mahal is a royal artwork of multiple talented artisans and artists. The area surrounding the Taj holds many decorative elements such as grass lawns and trees that increase the fragrance of the environment. A few feet apart, at the foothills of the entrance pathway lies a fascinating fountain gleaming with water.`,
  `King spent all his childhood in a segregated neighborhood and had a chance to see the opposite in Connecticut. He came to Morehouse here for his freshman year and had an opportunity to see things from a new perspective. Here was also where King reconciled with his Baptist upbringing. He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts from Morehouse.`,
  `In 1955, Claudette Corvin and Rosa Parks refused to give up their seats for white people on the bus in separate incidents. This sparked off the Montgomery bus boycott that King led. It lasted for 385, during which King's house was bombed. He was arrested as well, but this incident resulted in removing segregation on public buses in Montgomery. This boycott launched King into a national figure and spokesman for the movement against racial discrimination.`,
  `While he found favor in some officials' eyes, he put himself squarely in opposition to the President when he spoke against the war in Vietnam. King not only fought for his people but spoke out against all injustice whenever he could. He was also branded a communist by the FBI and was under constant surveillance. So much so that when he was assassinated, it was speculated whether it was the work of just one man or King's death was a part of a bigger conspiracy.`,
  `James Earl Ray was the man who ended King's long fight against racial discrimination. King was fatally shot, and not even surgery could save him. His death caused nationwide rioting, which took great effort to put an end to Racism.`,
  `Born into a Jewish family on 14th March 1879 in Germany, Einstein had early speech difficulties, still he was a topper at the elementary school. His father, Hermann Einstein was a salesman and engineer, who with his brother, founded an electrical equipment manufacturing company. Albert had a sister, Maja, two years younger to him. When Albert was five, his father showed him a pocket compass. Albert realized that something in empty space was moving the needle and later stated that this experience made 'a deep and lasting impression' on him.`,
  `From the latter book, Albert began to understand deductive reasoning, and by the age of 12, he learned Euclidian geometry from a school booklet. In his early teens, Albert attended the new and progressive Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended him to pursue electrical engineering, but Albert clashed with the authorities and resented rote learning. According to him, the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in rote learning.`,
  `In 1894, when Einstein was fifteen, his father's business failed and the family moved to Italy. During this time, he wrote his first scientific work, 'The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields'. Now rather than completing high school, Albert decided to apply directly to the ETH it's in German language that's why not written Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.`,
  `The year 1905 was very fortunate for Einstein. While working in the patent office, he published four papers in the prestigious journal 'Annalen der Physik'. All the four papers are today recognized as tremendous achievements and hence, 1905 is known as Einstein's 'Wonderful year'.`,
  `These were on photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity and equivalence of matter and energy. He deduced the well-known equation, E = mc square, implying that tiny particles of matter could be converted to huge amounts of energy. This late laid the foundations of nuclear energy.`,
  `However, shortly afterwards, he accepted a full professorship at the Charles University of Prague. Here, he published a paper about the effects of gravity on light. This paper appealed the astronomers and they started finding ways of detecting the deflection during a solar eclipse.`,
  `Mental health is crucial and integrates a component of health. Mental health includes an individual's psychological, emotional and social well-being. Proper mental health results in the proper mental functioning that result in being productive in activities, healthy and fulfilling relationships with other people and having the ability to cope and adapt to adversity.`,
  `Even though mental health is a highly personal thing, what affects one person may or may not affect the other person; however, some significant factors contribute to mental health problems. These factors include life experiences such as trauma or abuse, biological factors such as genes or chemistry of the brain, and even the family history of mental health problems can affect an individual. Poor mental health is also linked with stressful work conditions, rapid social changes, gender discrimination, gender discrimination, social exclusion, physical illness and human rights violation.`,
  `Mental health and mental illness together go hand in hand. Individuals having optimal mental health conditions can also face mental illness, where people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health. In recent times, people have started taking mental health seriously and taking proper steps in dealing with any mental health issues. Help is available out there; people with mental health problems can get better by seeking help`,
  `Positive mental health allows people to realize their full potential, cope with stress in life, work productively and make meaningful contributions to the community. Various factors in people's lives such as intrapersonal relations, physical factors, childhood trauma and many other conditions can disrupt mental health conditions. Taking care and looking after one's mental health preserves an individual's ability to enjoy life.`,
  `Global warming is the latest alarm bell for earth's environment. Global warming refers to the increase in average temperature of earth's surface during the last century, from 1900-2000. Earth's surface's temperature has increased more than one degree Fahrenheit since 1900. Global warming is alarming because of its adverse effects on the ecological balance of earth.`,
  `Greenhouse effect is a natural process wherein sunlight passes through atmosphere, warming earth's surface. Then, the earth's surface and water bodies release energy in form of heat or infrared radiations into atmosphere and maintains balance with the incoming energy. Greenhouse gases can absorb some of the infrared radiation. But increase in greenhouse gases has led to more absorption of infrared radiation which in turn has led to the increase of earth's surface temperature.`,
  `There is no doubt that the ever increasing phenomenon of global warming would lead to a total extinction of any form of life from earth's face. Global warming deplets the ozone layer and might lead us to the doom's day. It is a wake-up call for us to amend our ways of living to limit the use of products that contribute to the increase in global warming.`,
  `Martin Luther King Jr. in one of his letters from Birmingham prison said that through painful experience alone we can know that freedom is not something that is freely given. The ones who do not have it, must demand it. It shows his grit and perseverance even in the face of opposition. King was a civil rights activist for the Afro-American people. Never forgetting his ideals and principles of non-violence, he fought for the freedom of his people. His leadership was pivotal in legally putting an end to racial segregation in America.`,
  `Racism was something that he was acutely aware of as he grew up. Right from the age of six, his friendship with a white boy was taken away when his parents decided that they did not want their son to associate with a black boy. His father played a significant role in educating King about the long history of oppression and racism that his people had faced in America for years. His father was also someone who took a stand against segregation and discrimination when he could.`,
  `Growing older, King began to hate the whites for the racism he had seen and gone through. He also began to stray from what he had learned in his Baptist upbringing. The oratory skills that King would later be famous for began to bloom around his adolescence. The very first speech that he gave was in his junior year. He said that the black Americans still wear chains, though slavery was abolished years ago. Even a highly esteemed black man is still inferior to the cruelest white man.`,
  `Scolding is something common in student life. Being a naughty boy, I am always scolded by my parents. But one day I was severely scolded by my English teacher. She infect teaches well. But that day, I could not resist the temptation that an adventure of Nancy Drew offered. While she was teaching, I was completely engrossed in reading that book. Nancy Drew was caught in the trap laid by some smugglers and it was then when I felt a light tap on my bent head. The teacher had caught me red handed. She scolded me then and there and insulted me in front of the whole class.`,
  `I was embarrassed. My cheeks burned being guilty conscious. When the class was over, I went to the teacher to apologize. When she saw that I had realized my mistake, she cooled down and then told me in a very kind manner how disheartening it was when she found any student not paying attention. I was genuinely sorry and promised to myself never to commit such a mistake again.`,
  `Days are not of equal value in one's life. Some bring happiness while others bring sadness. Sadness and happiness both are equally important to man's life, since they are the two sides of a coin. As we cannot forget the happiest day, we are unable to forget the saddest day of our life too. The saddest day of my life was the Diwali Day. Diwali is considered to be a happy festival and till last Diwali, it was my favorite festival. On last Diwali, my sister, my brother and I were busy lighting the fireworks. I was holding a 'fuljhari' in my hand and unfortunately my younger brother, who was standing just beside me, had a cracker in his hand.`,
  `This cracker caught fire and a very loud explosion was heard which shook my sister and me. After that, we all could think of nothing else than blood stained cotton, bandage, dettol etc. My cousin took my brother to the doctor where he got 14 stitches in his forefinger and thumb. But at home, everybody kept cursing and blaming me for the mishap. That night, I could not sleep and I cried a lot. For next few days, I bore the burden of this blame for being responsible for this unfortunate incident.`,
  `Studying is the main source of knowledge. Books are indeed never failing friends of man. For a mature mind, reading is the greatest source of pleasure and solace to distressed minds. The study of good books ennobles us and broadens our outlook. Therefore, the habit of reading should be cultivated. A student should never confine himself to his schoolbooks only. He should not miss the pleasure locked in the classics, poetry, drama, history, philosophy etc.`,
  `We can derive benefit from other's experiences with the help of books. The various sufferings, endurance and joy described in books enable us to have a closer look at human life. They also inspire us to face the hardships of life courageously. Nowadays there are innumerable books and time is scarce.`,
  `Recently, an exhibition 'Building A New India' was held in the capital. It was organized by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The exhibition was set up in the Triveni Kala Sangam. The chief exhibits were photographs, novels, some sculptures by Indian modern artists presenting Indian cultural inheritance.`,
  `First of all, I visited the general section of the exhibition where different charts and photographs depicting India's development in various fields were set. Most impressive photographs among these were those showing India's nuclear development. The second section dealt with India's magnificent historical background. I was fascinated by the pictures of Mohanjodaro excavation.`,
  `I saw the most beautiful and colorful section of the exhibition i.e. the cultural section. It consisted of paintings, sculptures, photographs etc. The Rajasthani and Gujarati paintings were very colourful and attractive. This exhibition, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, lasted for a week.`,
  `It proved to be of great educational value. It brushed up my knowledge about India as my motherland. It enhanced my respect for my great country, India. I would very much appreciate if the Indian government organized some more such exhibitions.`,
  `There are three types of computers, which include analog, digital and hybrid computers. The speed, as well as the accuracy of each computer, is classified. The computer has several functions other than processing and storing data. It helps control the machine, organize the business, sell services and products, and definitely for academic purposes. The computer has found its way in our daily lives with its great usefulness.`,
  `Now it is impossible in our life to imagine without a computer. The invention of the computer helped many people's dreams change into reality. For lots of purposes, the computer can be used like storing information, programming, and developing software, calculation and email purposes, and many more.`,
  `The computer is one of the best creations of man. It is the most refreshing result of science and innovation that has made our lives so simpler. Computers are getting ubiquitous as we can find computers from anywhere, like from homes, schools, universities, workplaces, research centers to libraries, exhibition halls, and even emergency clinics.`,
  `The giant ENIAC machine computer discovered by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert was the first computer. It was built in the United States. It was similar to the Colossus. It was very faster and also very flexible.`,
  `As noted by Discovery, the Creeper program, often regarded as the first virus, was created in 1971 by Bob Thomas of BBN. Creeper was actually designed as a security test to see if a self-replicating program was possible.`,
  `Indeed computer is very helpful device, it is used in all fields and at every walk of life. It is a boon for mankind. All inventions are very beneficial but sometimes these inventions become a bane for mankind. Because of computer and its wide use human have forgot to work.`,
  `The computer is one of the biggest inventions in the history of science. The entire world has been changed due to this amazing invention. It is a device that worked with lots of commands. It can't work itself. An operator needs to control this. The computer has a huge impact on human life. It has changed lots of scenarios. A computer works with three steps; these are input, process, and output. First of all, you have to give a command as input, the machine will process this and will show you output. It works a lot faster than any other device.`,
  `When the computer was invented, that a heavy, large and costly device. But now everyone can get a computer. Before then, it was strictly used for storing data and most of the time only the government used that. The world has been way easier now to use a computer. A computer can open a new world in front of you.`,
  `A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.`,
  `Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.`
